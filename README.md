# Learning DSA

This repository is for learning DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms).

As we all know that DSA plays a very important role in reducing the time complexity of the code. A problem might have several approaches, but you must pick the optimized one in order to stand out of the crowd. You must be able to write a code which takes less time to execute for any problem statement given.

# Why DSA ?

Because DSA is a tough battle and Tough battle gives confidence in interviewðŸ˜Š.
DSA helps us to improve our logical ability.

# What is in this Repo ?

This repo contains concepts such as STACK, QUEUE, LINKED LIST, RECURSION, and etc. as well as a coding example in different languages such as JAVA, PYTHON, C, C++, etc.
