# Introduction to stack

## Introduction

• In Simple words we can say Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO(Last-In-First-Out) or FILO(First-In-Last-Out) order to perform operations.
(Data Structure is a way to organize data in a way that enables data to be processed in a short time.)
• LIFO means the Last added element is removed first.
we can imagine We keep books on our study table is stacked over one another, The book which is at the top is the first one to be removed
• suppose we want to organize data in a stack, so we push the data one by one.
• And if we want to remove the element from the stack then we use pop() function which remove element from the top of the stack.

## Features of Stack

• Stack is a collection of similar type of data.
• In stack we store data using push() function and remove data using pop() function.
• It provide discipline to the data.

## Method of Stack

push() :- To insert an element into the stack. Which is at the top of the stack.
pop() :- To remove an element from the stack. Which is at the top of the stack.
peek() or top() :- It return element without removing actual element from the stack.
size() :- It is return the size of the stack i.e. number of elements present in the stack.
empty() :- It return Boolean(true or false) value, return true if the stack is empty and return false if the stack is not empty.

## Application of stack

• Used in function call.
• Infix to postfix conversion.
• Infix to prefix conversion.
• Balance Brackets.
